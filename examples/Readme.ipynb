    "Later **recordclass** library started to provide record-like classes that do not participate in *cyclic garbage collection* (CGC) mechanism, but support only *reference counting* mechanizm for garbage collection.\n",
    "The instances of such classes have not `PyGC_Head` prefix in the memory, which decrease their size.\n",
    "This may make sense in cases where it is necessary to limit the size of objects as much as possible, provided that they will never be part of circular references in the application.\n",
    "For example, when an object represents a record with fields that represent simple values by convention (`int`, `float`, `str`, `date`/`time`/`datetime`, `timedelta`, etc.).\n",
    "Another examples are non-recursive data structures in which all leaf elements represent simple values.\n",
    "Of course, in python, nothing prevents you from “shooting yourself in the foot\" by creating the reference cycle in the script or application code.\n",
    "But in some cases, this can still be avoided provided that the developer understands\n",

It's memory footprint is similar to memory footprint of instances of the classes with `__slots__` . The difference is equal to the size of `PyGC_Head`.
